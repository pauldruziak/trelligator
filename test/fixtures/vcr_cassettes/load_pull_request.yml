        was in this line from `initialize` method:\r\n`@client = Event::GoogleCalendarClient.new(integration).client`\r\nBecause
        when we call later from `client_excute!`:\r\n`client.refresh_access_token!`\r\nWe
        expect that `client` is `Event::GoogleCalendarClient`, but it was `Google::APIClient`.\r\nSo,
        in this PR I change it to `Event::GoogleCalendarClient`, this is more logical.
        And we now use `GoogleCalendarClient` as proxy for `APIClient`.
